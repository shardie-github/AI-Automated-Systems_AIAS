# LinkedIn Launch Post - Edge AI Accelerator Studio

---

🚀 **Announcing Edge AI Accelerator Studio** 🚀

We're excited to launch a new core pillar of AIAS: **Edge AI Accelerator Studio** — a comprehensive platform for optimizing and deploying AI models at the edge.

**Why Edge AI?**

As AI becomes more pervasive, running inference at the edge (on-device, locally) is becoming critical for:
- ⚡ **Lower Latency**: Sub-10ms inference without cloud round-trips
- 🔒 **Privacy**: Keep sensitive data on-device, PIPEDA compliant
- 💰 **Cost Savings**: Eliminate cloud inference costs and bandwidth usage
- 🌐 **Offline Capability**: Work without internet connectivity

**What We Built:**

✅ **Model Optimization**: Quantize and compress models (INT8, INT4, FP8, GGUF) — reduce size by up to 75% while maintaining accuracy

✅ **Device Profiling**: Pre-configured templates for Jetson, AI PCs, Android, iOS, Raspberry Pi, and custom devices

✅ **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure latency, throughput, memory usage, and hardware utilization

✅ **Export & Deploy**: Download optimized bundles, SDK scaffolds (TypeScript, Python, Java, Swift), Docker images, and deployment templates

**Use Cases:**

- Offline enterprise assistants for field workers
- Local AI tutors in education (no cloud dependency)
- Robotics & IoT with real-time edge inference
- Retail analytics with on-premise vision systems
- Privacy-preserving AI for healthcare and finance

**For Developers:**

Upload your model → Select target device → Optimize → Benchmark → Download & Deploy

All through a clean API and web interface. Integration with your existing AIAS workflows.
