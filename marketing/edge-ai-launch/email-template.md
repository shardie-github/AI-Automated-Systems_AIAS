### For Existing Customers

**Subject:** Introducing Edge AI Accelerator Studio — Optimize & Deploy AI at the Edge

Hi [Name],

We're excited to announce a major expansion of AIAS: **Edge AI Accelerator Studio** is now live.

**What is Edge AI?**

Edge AI enables you to run AI inference locally on devices (AI PCs, Jetsons, mobile devices, edge servers) instead of sending data to the cloud. This means:

- ⚡ **Faster**: Sub-10ms latency without network delays
- 🔒 **More Private**: Data stays on-device, PIPEDA compliant
- 💰 **Lower Costs**: Eliminate cloud inference costs
- 🌐 **Works Offline**: No internet required

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Upload Your Models**: Support for ONNX, TensorFlow Lite, GGUF, CoreML, TensorRT, and more
2. **Optimize for Edge**: Quantize and compress models (reduce size by 70-90%)
3. **Profile Devices**: Pre-configured templates for Jetson, AI PCs, Android, iOS, Raspberry Pi
4. **Benchmark Performance**: Measure latency, throughput, and resource usage
5. **Export & Deploy**: Download optimized bundles, SDKs, and deployment templates

**Perfect For:**

- Offline enterprise assistants
- Local AI tutors and educational tools
- Robotics and IoT applications
- Privacy-sensitive applications (healthcare, finance)
- Retail analytics with on-premise systems

**Get Started:**

### For Prospects / New Leads

**Subject:** New: Run AI Inference Locally with Edge AI Accelerator Studio

Hi [Name],

We just launched **Edge AI Accelerator Studio** — a platform for optimizing and deploying AI models at the edge.

**Why Edge AI Matters:**

Running AI inference locally (on-device) instead of in the cloud delivers:
- **10x Lower Latency**: Sub-10ms inference vs. 100-500ms cloud
- **Better Privacy**: Data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Lower Costs**: Eliminate cloud inference fees
- **Offline Capability**: Work without internet

**What We Built:**

A complete platform to:
- Optimize models with quantization (INT8, INT4, FP8, GGUF)
- Profile device capabilities (Jetson, AI PCs, Android, iOS, etc.)
- Benchmark performance (latency, throughput, memory)
- Export deployment-ready bundles and SDKs

**Use Cases:**

- Offline enterprise assistants
- Local AI tutors in education
- Robotics & IoT with real-time inference
- Privacy-preserving AI applications
- Retail edge analytics
