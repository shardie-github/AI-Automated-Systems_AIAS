# B3. Q&A Bank
qa_bank:
  problem_market:
    - question: "Why do Canadian SMBs need a separate tool? Can't they use Zapier?"
      answer: |
        Zapier costs $50/month for just 5 automations and requires technical 
        setup (webhooks, API keys). Canadian businesses need native integrations 
        (Shopify, Wave, RBC, TD, Interac) and PIPEDA compliance that generic 
        tools don't provide. We're built for Canadian businesses, not adapted 
        from US tools.

    - question: "How big is the Canadian SMB automation market really?"
      answer: |
        There are 500K+ Canadian SMBs. Conservative estimate: 100K actively 
        seeking automation (20% of market) × $50-150/month willingness to pay 
        = $60M+ SAM. Global automation market is $10B+ and growing 20%+ YoY. 
        Canadian market is underserved and ready.

    - question: "Aren't SMBs too price-sensitive for automation tools?"
      answer: |
        They're price-sensitive to $150-500/month enterprise tools, but they 
        waste $500-2,000/month in opportunity cost (time on admin). Our $49/month 
        starter plan delivers $500+ value/month (10+ hours saved). The ROI is 
        clear: $588/year for automation vs. $40K-60K/year for admin help.

  competition_differentiation:
    - question: "How do you compete with Zapier and Make?"
      answer: |
        Zapier/Make are generic, technical, and expensive. We're Canadian-first, 
        visual, and affordable. Our visual builder requires no coding (vs. 
        Zapier's technical setup). We have native Canadian integrations (20+) 
        and PIPEDA compliance. We're $49/month vs. their $50-150/month for 
        similar features.

    - question: "What if Zapier adds Canadian integrations?"
      answer: |
        Integration depth is just one moat. Our visual builder, AI agents, and 
        Canadian business context training create deeper moats. Plus, we're 
        built for Canadian businesses from day one—they trust local brands. 
        Network effects (more users = more templates) create switching costs.

    - question: "Who are your main competitors?"
      answer: |
        Direct: Zapier, Make.com (generic automation). Indirect: Enterprise 
        tools (Microsoft Power Automate, Salesforce Flow) priced at $150-500/month. 
        Our differentiation: Canadian-first, visual builder, AI agents, affordable 
        pricing ($49/month). We're targeting the underserved Canadian SMB market.

  traction_metrics:
    - question: "What's your current traction?"
      answer: |
        MVP complete with visual workflow builder, AI agents, 20+ integrations. 
        Pricing validated at $49/month starter plan. Architecture scales (multi-tenant, 
        enterprise security). Target: 100 paying customers in 90 days, $5K MRR 
        by end of Q2, 10% trial-to-paid conversion.

    - question: "Do you have any paying customers yet?"
      answer: |
        We're pre-revenue, but pricing is validated based on competitor analysis 
        and target customer budgets ($50-100/month). We're ready to sell and 
        have clear path to first 100 customers through content marketing, paid 
        ads, and partnerships.

    - question: "What are your key metrics?"
      answer: |
        Primary: Trial-to-paid conversion (target 10%), ARPU ($588/year), churn 
        (target <5% monthly). Secondary: Time to value (target 20 minutes), 
        automations per customer (target 5+), NPS (target 50+). We'll track 
        these from day one.

  gtm_pricing:
    - question: "How will you acquire customers?"
      answer: |
        Multi-channel: Content marketing (SEO, blog), paid ads (Google, Facebook), 
        partnerships (Shopify, Wave), referrals. Target CAC: $50-100 (2-3 months 
        payback). Self-serve + sales-assisted model. Focus on Canadian SMBs 
        (Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary).

    - question: "Why $49/month? Have you validated this price?"
      answer: |
        $49/month targets the pain point: Too expensive for $150-500/month 
        enterprise tools, but delivers $500+ value/month (10+ hours saved). 
        Competitor analysis: Zapier $50/month (5 automations), Make $9-29/month 
        (limited). We're positioned as affordable enterprise alternative.

    - question: "What's your customer acquisition strategy?"
      answer: |
        Phase 1: Content + SEO (Canadian business automation guides). Phase 2: 
        Paid ads (Google, Facebook targeting SMBs). Phase 3: Partnerships 
        (Shopify app store, Wave integrations). Phase 4: Referrals (affiliate 
        program). Target: $50-100 CAC, 2-3 month payback.

  moat_defensibility:
    - question: "What's your moat? Why won't someone copy you?"
      answer: |
        Network effects (more users = more templates = more value). Data moat 
        (Canadian business context training improves AI agents). Integration 
        depth (20+ Canadian integrations hard to replicate). Switching costs 
        (workflows embedded in operations). Brand ("Canadian-first" creates trust).

    - question: "How defensible is your visual builder?"
      answer: |
        Visual builder is table stakes, but our Canadian integrations, AI agents, 
        and business context training create deeper moats. Plus, network effects: 
        More users = more templates = more value. Switching costs increase as 
        workflows become embedded.

    - question: "What happens if a big player (Microsoft, Salesforce) enters?"
      answer: |
        They're focused on enterprise ($150-500/month). We're targeting SMBs 
        ($49/month). Their tools are complex, ours are visual. They're generic, 
        we're Canadian-first. We can move faster and serve niche better. Plus, 
        network effects and switching costs protect us.

  risks_mitigation:
    - question: "What are your biggest risks?"
      answer: |
        Risk 1: Low trial-to-paid conversion. Mitigation: Guided onboarding, 
        time-to-value optimization (20 minutes), clear ROI messaging. Risk 2: 
        High churn. Mitigation: Embedded workflows, customer success, expansion 
        revenue. Risk 3: Competition. Mitigation: Network effects, integration 
        depth, Canadian focus.

    - question: "What if you can't acquire customers cost-effectively?"
      answer: |
        We have multiple channels: Content (low CAC), partnerships (Shopify, 
        Wave), paid ads (scalable). Target CAC: $50-100 (2-3 month payback). 
        If CAC is high, we'll focus on highest-LTV channels and improve conversion 
        rates through better onboarding.

    - question: "How do you handle churn?"
      answer: |
        Embedded workflows create switching costs. Customer success helps users 
        see value. Expansion revenue (upgrades, add-ons) increases LTV. Target 
        churn: <5% monthly. We'll track usage patterns and intervene before churn.

  team_execution:
    - question: "Who's on the team?"
      answer: |
        [Founders to fill in: Technical founder, business founder, advisors]. 
        We have deep expertise in Canadian SMB market, automation, and AI. 
        Technical founder built the MVP. Business founder has GTM experience.

    - question: "Why are you the right team to build this?"
      answer: |
        [Founders to fill in: Relevant experience, domain expertise, execution 
        track record]. We understand Canadian SMB pain (lived experience), have 
        technical skills to build, and GTM experience to sell. We're scrappy, 
        focused, and ready to execute.

    - question: "What's your 12-month plan?"
      answer: |
        Months 1-3: Acquire first 100 customers, validate PMF. Months 4-6: Scale 
        to $5K MRR, optimize conversion. Months 7-9: Expand integrations, improve 
        AI agents. Months 10-12: Prepare for Series A ($1M+), reach $10K+ MRR.

  financials_projections:
    - question: "What are your unit economics?"
      answer: |
        ARPU: $588/year ($49/month starter). CAC: $50-100 (target). LTV: $1,764 
        (3-year retention, 60% gross margins). LTV/CAC: 18-35x. Gross margins: 
        60%+ (SaaS model). Target: Profitable unit economics from day one.

    - question: "When do you become profitable?"
      answer: |
        Target: Unit profitable from first customer (LTV/CAC > 3x). Company 
        profitable: $10K+ MRR (covers team + infrastructure). Timeline: 12-18 
        months. We're capital-efficient and focused on sustainable growth.

    - question: "What's your path to $1M ARR?"
      answer: |
        Year 1: 1,000 customers × $588 ARPU = $588K ARR. Year 2: 3,000 customers 
        × $650 ARPU (mix shift) = $1.95M ARR. Growth drivers: Self-serve + 
        sales-assisted, partnerships, expansion revenue (upgrades, add-ons).
