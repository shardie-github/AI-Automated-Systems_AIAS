## The Opportunity

**Problem:** Canadian small businesses waste 10-30 hours per week on manual, repetitive tasks. Existing automation tools cost $150-500/month and require technical expertise.

**Solution:** AIAS Platform provides visual workflow builders, pre-built templates, and Canadian-specific integrations (Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC) for $49/month—saving SMBs 10+ hours per week.

**Market:** 1.2M Canadian SMBs, $2.4B addressable market (SAM). Initial wedge: Shopify e-commerce operators (100K+ stores in Canada).
