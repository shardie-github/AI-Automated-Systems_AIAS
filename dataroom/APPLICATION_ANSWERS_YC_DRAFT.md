# YC Application Answers — Draft

**Purpose:** Draft answers to typical YC application questions  
**Status:** Draft — Founders to review and refine  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-31

## 1. What does your company do? (1 sentence)

**Draft Answer:**
AIAS Platform helps Canadian small businesses automate repetitive tasks through visual workflow builders and AI agents, eliminating the need for expensive enterprise tools or custom development.

**Cross-Reference:** See `yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` for product narrative.

## 2. What is your company going to make? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
AIAS Platform is an enterprise-grade automation platform built specifically for Canadian SMBs. We provide visual workflow builders (drag, drop, connect), pre-built templates (Shopify order automation, lead qualification, proposal generation), and Canadian-first integrations (Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC, TD, Interac) for $49/month—saving SMBs 10+ hours per week while they focus on growing their competitors charge $150-500/month. Our initial wedge is Shopify e-commerce operators (100K+ stores in Canada), and we'll expand to consultants, real estate agents, and other SMB segments after product-market fit.

**Cross-Reference:** See `yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` for detailed product narrative.

## 3. Please tell us about an idea you've had. (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
We noticed that Canadian SMBs waste 10-30 hours per week on manual, repetitive tasks. Sarah, a Shopify store owner, spends 3 hours daily on order confirmations and shipping labels. Mike, a consultant, writes 5-10 proposals per week manually. They can't afford enterprise automation tools ($150-500/month), and existing solutions like Zapier are too expensive ($50/month for just 5 automations) or too complex to set up.

We built AIAS Platform to solve this: visual workflow builders, pre-built templates, and Canadian-specific integrations for $49/month. We're starting with Shopify e-commerce operators (our initial wedge) and expanding from there.

**Cross-Reference:** See `yc/YC_PROBLEM_USERS.md` for problem statement.

---

## 4. Why will you succeed? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
We're uniquely positioned to win because: (1) **Canadian-first focus:** We understand Canadian SMB needs (Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC integrations) that generic tools don't provide. (2) **Affordable pricing:** $49/month vs. $150-500 competitors makes us accessible to SMBs. (3) **Visual builder:** No coding required, unlike technical competitors. (4) **Founder-market fit:** [PLACEHOLDER — Add founder background, e.g., "We've run Shopify stores and experienced this pain firsthand"].

**Cross-Reference:** See `yc/YC_DEFENSIBILITY_NOTES.md` for defensibility analysis.

## 5. How do you know people want this? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
[PLACEHOLDER — Add validation evidence]

**If you have customers:**
We have [X] paying customers generating $[X] MRR. Sarah, a Shopify store owner, saves 10 hours/week using our order automation workflow. Mike, a consultant, generates proposals in 5 minutes instead of 2 hours. Our activation rate is [X]%, retention is [X]% Day 7, and we're growing [X]% MoM.

**If you don't have customers:**
We've interviewed 20+ Canadian SMBs (Shopify store owners, consultants, real estate agents) and validated the pain: they waste 10-30 hours/week on manual tasks and can't afford $150-500/month tools. We're launching MVP in [Month] and have [X] early adopters signed up.

**TODO:** Replace placeholders with actual validation evidence. See `yc/YC_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` Gap 1 (Missing Real Customer Data).

## 6. What's new about what you're making? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
Three things: (1) **Canadian-first:** We're the only automation platform built specifically for Canadian SMBs with native integrations (Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC, TD, Interac). (2) **Affordable:** $49/month vs. $150-500 competitors makes us accessible to SMBs who can't afford Zapier or Make. (3) **Visual builder:** No coding required, unlike technical competitors. Our visual workflow builder lets users drag, drop, and connect integrations in minutes.

**Cross-Reference:** See `yc/YC_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` Gap 2 (Unclear "What's New/Different").

---

## 7. Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
**Direct competitors:** Zapier ($50/month for 5 automations, not Canadian-focused), Make ($9-29/month, limited features, complex setup), Microsoft Power Automate ($15/month, enterprise-focused).

**Indirect competitors:** Custom development (expensive, slow), manual processes (time-consuming, error-prone).

**Why we win:** Canadian-first focus (Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC integrations), affordable pricing ($49 vs. $150-500), visual builder (no coding required). We're starting with Shopify e-commerce operators (our initial wedge) and expanding from there.

**Cross-Reference:** See `yc/YC_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` Gap 2 for competitive analysis.

## 8. How do customers find out about you? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
**Primary channels:** (1) **Shopify App Store:** Native integration, app store listing (our initial wedge). (2) **SEO:** Content marketing, landing pages for high-intent keywords ("Shopify automation Canada"). (3) **Referrals:** Built-in referral system (users invite others, get rewards). (4) **Partnerships:** Integrations with Canadian tools (Wave Accounting, RBC) drive awareness.

**Current CAC:** $[X] (or "TBD" if not tracked). **LTV:** $[X] (or "TBD" if not calculated). **LTV:CAC:** [X]:1 (target: 3:1).

**TODO:** Replace placeholders with actual CAC/LTV numbers. See `yc/YC_DISTRIBUTION_PLAN.md` for distribution strategy.

## 9. How will you make money? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
**Primary revenue:** SaaS subscriptions ($49/month Starter, $149/month Pro, $499/month Enterprise). **Secondary revenue:** API usage (per-request pricing for high-volume customers). **Future revenue:** Marketplace commissions (when we launch AI agent marketplace).

**Current MRR:** $[X] (or "$0" if pre-revenue). **Paying customers:** [X] (or "0" if pre-revenue). **ARPU:** $[X] (or "TBD" if not calculated).

**TODO:** Replace placeholders with actual revenue numbers. See `yc/FINANCIAL_PROJECTIONS.md` for financial model.

---

## 10. How much money will you make? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
[PLACEHOLDER — Add financial projections]

**Year 1:** $[X] ARR (or "TBD" if not projected). **Year 2:** $[X] ARR (or "TBD" if not projected). **Year 3:** $[X] ARR (or "TBD" if not projected).

**Assumptions:** [X] customers/month growth, [X]% activation rate, [X]% retention, $[X] ARPU.

**TODO:** Replace placeholders with actual financial projections. See `yc/FINANCIAL_PROJECTIONS.md` for financial model.

---

## 11. How much does it cost to make what you're making? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
**Infrastructure:** ~$50/month (Supabase free tier, Vercel free tier). **AI APIs:** Pay-per-use, costs passed through to customers (~$100/month for [X] customers). **Total:** ~$150/month for [X] customers.

**As we scale:** Infrastructure scales with usage (Supabase/Vercel scale automatically). AI API costs scale with usage (costs passed through to customers). **Unit economics:** Positive unit economics (LTV:CAC > 3:1 target).

**TODO:** Replace placeholders with actual cost numbers. See `yc/FINANCIAL_PROJECTIONS.md` for cost projections.

## 12. Who is on your team? (1 paragraph)

**Draft Answer:**
I'm Scott Hardie, founder and CEO of AIAS Platform. I'm a full-stack developer based in Toronto, Canada, with experience running e-commerce operations (Hardonia.store) and building automation tools. I've experienced firsthand the pain of manual workflows—spending 15+ hours per week on order processing, trying expensive tools ($150-500/month), and struggling with complex setups. I built AIAS Platform to solve this problem for Canadian SMBs who can't afford enterprise tools but need automation. I'm an active open-source contributor with 40+ public repositories and have built Hardonian Industries, giving me both technical execution capability and business experience.

**Cross-Reference:** See `yc/YC_TEAM_NOTES.md` for detailed team information.
