Notes:
- Cohort Analysis: Track retention by sign-up month
- Month 0: Sign-up month (100% retention baseline)
- Month 1-6: Retention percentages (e.g., Month 1 = 70% means 70% of cohort still active)
- Assumes 70% Month 1 retention, declining to 60% Month 2, etc.
- Use for calculating cohort-based retention and LTV

Calculation:
- Retention Rate = (Active Users in Month N) / (Cohort Size)
- Example: January cohort Month 1 retention = 70 / 100 = 70%
