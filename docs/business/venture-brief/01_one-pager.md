# AIAS Platform — One-Pager

**Venture:** AIAS (AI Agent & Automation Solutions Platform)  
**Target:** Canadian businesses seeking AI automation  
**Launch:** Q1 2024 | **Pricing:** Starting at CAD $49/month

---

## The Problem

Canadian businesses waste 15+ hours per week on repetitive tasks that AI can automate. Current solutions are either too expensive (enterprise-only), too generic (chatbots that don't integrate), or require technical expertise businesses don't have.

**Time-saver ROI for solo operators:**
- Save 10 hours/week on routine automation → reclaim 40+ hours/month
- Reduce manual errors by 90% → fewer costly mistakes
- Launch AI-powered workflows in <30 minutes → no coding required

## The Solution

AIAS Platform is a no-code AI agent builder that lets Canadian businesses create, deploy, and manage custom AI agents and automation workflows without technical expertise.

**How it works:**
1. **Choose a template** or build from scratch (drag-and-drop interface)
2. **Connect your tools** (100+ integrations: Slack, Google Workspace, Shopify, etc.)
3. **Deploy in minutes** — AI agents work 24/7, handling tasks automatically
4. **Monitor & optimize** — real-time analytics show ROI and performance

## Why Now (Canada Context)

- **AI adoption accelerating:** 42% of Canadian SMBs plan to adopt AI in 2024 (StatCan)
- **Labour shortage:** 1M+ job vacancies; automation fills gaps without hiring
- **Privacy-first:** PIPEDA-compliant platform; data stays in Canada where possible
- **Affordable access:** CAD pricing, no hidden FX fees; designed for Canadian budgets

## Who It's For

**Primary:** Canadian solo entrepreneurs and small businesses (1-10 employees)
- **E-commerce store owners** automating order processing and customer support
- **Consultants** automating proposal writing and client follow-ups
- **Real estate agents** managing lead qualification and scheduling
- **Service providers** handling booking, invoicing, and reminders

**Secondary:** Canadian mid-market companies (10-50 employees) seeking cost-effective AI automation before enterprise solutions.
