## Discovery Call Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
```
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to chat. I'm [Your Name], founder of AIAS Platform.

I saw you signed up for our free tier — that's great! I'd love to learn more about your business and see how AIAS Platform can help you save time.

Can you tell me a bit about what you do?"
```

### Discovery Questions (5-10 minutes)
```
1. "What does your business do?"
2. "What are your biggest time-wasters?"
3. "Are you currently using any automation tools?"
4. "What's your biggest challenge with automation?"
5. "What would you do with 10 extra hours per week?"
```

### Closing (2-3 minutes)
```
"Based on what you've told me, I think AIAS Platform could help you save [X] hours per week by automating [Specific Task].

Would you like to see a quick demo of how that would work?"
```

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
```
"I understand price is a concern. Let me put it in perspective:

AIAS Platform costs CAD $49/month. If it saves you 10 hours per week, that's 40 hours per month. At your hourly rate of [X], that's CAD $[X] in value per month.

So you're paying CAD $49 to save CAD $[X] — that's a [X]x return on investment.

Plus, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't save you time, we'll refund every penny.

Does that make sense?"
```

### Objection 2: "I'm not technical"

**Response:**
```
"That's exactly why we built AIAS Platform — it's designed for non-technical users.

Our no-code builder means you can create workflows in 30 minutes, not 2 hours. We have 50+ pre-built templates, so you don't need to build from scratch.

Plus, we have step-by-step tutorials and email support. Most users create their first workflow in 30 minutes.

Would you like to see a quick demo?"
```

### Objection 3: "I'm already using [Competitor]"

**Response:**
```
"That's great! [Competitor] is a solid tool. What do you like about it?

[Wait for response]

What I hear from users who switch is:
- AIAS Platform is more affordable (CAD $49 vs. CAD $[X])
- We have Canadian integrations they need (Shopify, Wave, RBC)
- Our AI agents are more intelligent (context-aware, not just workflows)

We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't work better than [Competitor], we'll refund you.

Would you like to try it and compare?"
```

### Objection 4: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
```
"Of course, I understand. What specifically would you like to think about?

[Wait for response]

Based on what you've told me, I think AIAS Platform could save you [X] hours per week. That's [X] hours per month, or [X] hours per year.

If you're not sure, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can try it risk-free, and if it doesn't work, we'll refund you.

What do you think?"
```
