## OBJECTION HANDLING

### Common Objections & Responses:

**"We're not ready for automation."**
- **Response**: "Many customers say that, but automation actually helps you get ready. Start small with one workflow, see the value, then expand. What's one process you'd like to automate?"

**"We don't have budget."**
- **Response**: "I understand budget constraints. Let's calculate the ROI. If we save you [X] hours per week, that's [Y] hours per year. At [Z] per hour, that's [Value] in savings. Our platform pays for itself. Would a Starter tier at $99/month work?"

**"We need to think about it."**
- **Response**: "Of course. What specifically would you like to think about? Is there information I can provide to help with your decision?"

**"We're evaluating other options."**
- **Response**: "That makes sense. What criteria are you using to evaluate? I'd love to show you how AIAS Platform compares on those criteria."

**"We need custom features."**
- **Response**: "What specific features do you need? Many customers find our platform handles 90% of their needs. For the remaining 10%, we offer custom integrations and white-label options."
