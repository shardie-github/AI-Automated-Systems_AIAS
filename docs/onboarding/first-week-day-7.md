# First Week Check-In: Day 7 Guide

Congratulations on completing your first week with AIAS Platform! Let's review your progress and optimize your automations.

## Week 1 Review

**Goal:** Review your workflows, identify improvements, and plan next steps.

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes

**What You'll Accomplish:**
- ✅ Review workflow performance
- ✅ Identify optimization opportunities
- ✅ Plan additional automations
- ✅ Set up monitoring and alerts

---

## Step 1: Review Your Workflow Performance (5 minutes)

1. Go to **Analytics** → **Workflow Performance**
2. Review your metrics:
   - **Total Executions:** How many times your workflows ran
   - **Success Rate:** Percentage of successful executions
   - **Time Saved:** Estimated hours saved
   - **Errors:** Any failures that need attention

**Questions to Ask:**
- Are your workflows running as expected?
- Are there any errors that need fixing?
- Which workflows are most valuable?

---

## Step 2: Check for Errors (5 minutes)

1. Go to **Workflows** → Select each workflow
2. Check the **Execution Log** for any errors
3. Review error messages and fix issues:
   - **Integration disconnected?** Reconnect in Settings
   - **Invalid configuration?** Update workflow settings
   - **API rate limits?** Adjust workflow frequency

**Common Issues:**
- Integration tokens expired → Reconnect integration
- Missing required fields → Update workflow configuration
- API errors → Check integration status

---

## Step 3: Optimize Your Workflows (5 minutes)

### Review Each Workflow

For each active workflow, ask:

1. **Is it still needed?**
   - If not, archive it to reduce clutter

2. **Can it be improved?**
   - Add conditions to reduce unnecessary executions
   - Combine similar workflows
   - Add error handling

3. **Is it saving time?**
   - Check execution frequency
   - Verify it's handling the right tasks
   - Consider if it needs more steps

### Optimization Tips

- **Add Filters:** Only trigger workflows when conditions are met
- **Combine Steps:** Reduce the number of separate workflows
- **Add Notifications:** Get alerts when workflows fail
- **Schedule Optimization:** Run workflows at optimal times

## Step 4: Plan Additional Automations (5 minutes)

### Identify New Opportunities

Think about tasks you still do manually:

1. **Email Tasks:**
   - Auto-respond to common inquiries
