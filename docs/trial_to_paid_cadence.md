## Consulting Time Positioning

- Implies it's part of onboarding
- Feels like a bonus, not a sales pitch

### When to Pitch

1. **Pricing Page** (always visible)
   - "Includes 30-minute onboarding session"
   - Part of paid plan benefits

2. **In-App Banner** (Day 5-10)
   - "Unlock your free onboarding session"
   - Appears after user has engaged with platform
   - CTA: "Schedule Session" → booking calendar

3. **Trial Day 5-10 Email**
   - "Ready to maximize your results?"
   - "Book your free onboarding session"
   - Link to booking

4. **Upgrade Flow** (Day 25-27)
   - "Upgrade now and get your onboarding session"
   - Part of upgrade benefits

### Trigger
**Recommendation:** Available on upgrade (not trial activation)
- Reduces cost (only paying customers)
- Increases upgrade motivation
- Feels like exclusive benefit
