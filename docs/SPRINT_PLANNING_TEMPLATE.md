## 1. SPRINT GOAL

### Goal Statement
**By the end of this 30-day sprint, [USER] can [ACTION] and we can measure [METRIC].**

**Example:**
> By the end of this 30-day sprint, a user can deploy one pre-built AI agent and have it responding to queries via chat interface. We can measure deployments and active conversations.

### Success Criteria (3-5 Measurable Outcomes)

1. ✅ **[Outcome 1]** - Measurable: [How we measure]
2. ✅ **[Outcome 2]** - Measurable: [How we measure]
3. ✅ **[Outcome 3]** - Measurable: [How we measure]
4. ✅ **[Learning Outcome]** - Measurable: [How we validate]
5. ✅ **[Technical Outcome]** - Measurable: [How we verify]

**Example:**
1. ✅ Users can deploy agents - Measurable: Deployment API creates records, telemetry event fires
2. ✅ Agents respond to queries - Measurable: Chat API returns OpenAI responses, response time <2s
3. ✅ We can measure deployments - Measurable: Dashboard shows deployment count
4. ✅ We learn user behavior - Measurable: 5 user testing sessions completed, feedback documented
5. ✅ System is reliable - Measurable: Error rate <1%, uptime >99%
