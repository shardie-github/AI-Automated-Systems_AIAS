**Last Updated:** 2025-01-29  
**Purpose:** Document previous iterations, approaches, and learning from failures

---

## Idea Maze Overview

**Current Approach:** Canadian-first automation platform for SMBs ($49/month, visual workflow builder, Canadian integrations)

**Previous Approaches:** [TODO: Document previous approaches if any]

---

## Previous Iterations

### Iteration 1: [Previous Approach Name]

**What We Tried:**
- [TODO: Description of previous approach]
- Example: "Built custom automation tool for single client"

**Why It Didn't Work:**
- [TODO: Reason it didn't work]
- Example: "Too expensive to build for each client, not scalable"

**What We Learned:**
- [TODO: Key learning]
- Example: "Need productized solution, not custom development"

**How It Informed Current Approach:**
- [TODO: Connection to current approach]
- Example: "Led to productized platform approach (AIAS Platform)"

---

### Iteration 2: [Previous Approach Name]

**What We Tried:**
- [TODO: Description of previous approach]
- Example: "Built generic automation tool (not Canadian-specific)"

**Why It Didn't Work:**
- [TODO: Reason it didn't work]
- Example: "Too generic, didn't differentiate from competitors"

**What We Learned:**
- [TODO: Key learning]
- Example: "Need Canadian-first approach to differentiate"

**How It Informed Current Approach:**
- [TODO: Connection to current approach]
- Example: "Led to Canadian-first positioning (native integrations, PIPEDA compliance)"

---

### Iteration 3: [Previous Approach Name]

**What We Tried:**
- [TODO: Description of previous approach]
- Example: "Built technical automation tool (required coding)"

**Why It Didn't Work:**
- [TODO: Reason it didn't work]
- Example: "Too complex for non-technical users, low adoption"

**What We Learned:**
- [TODO: Key learning]
- Example: "Need no-code visual builder for non-technical users"

**How It Informed Current Approach:**
- [TODO: Connection to current approach]
- Example: "Led to visual workflow builder (drag-and-drop, no coding)"

## Current Approach: AIAS Platform

### What We're Building
- **Product:** Canadian-first automation platform for SMBs
- **Pricing:** $49/month starter plan (vs. $150-500 competitors)
- **Features:** Visual workflow builder, Canadian integrations, enterprise security
- **Target:** Canadian e-commerce SMBs (Shopify store owners)

### Why This Approach Works
- **Affordable:** $49/month fits SMB budget (vs. $150-500 competitors)
- **No-Code:** Visual workflow builder (vs. technical setup)
- **Canadian-First:** Native integrations (Shopify, Wave, RBC, TD), PIPEDA compliance
- **Enterprise Features:** SOC 2, GDPR, PIPEDA compliance included

### What We're Learning
- [TODO: Current learnings]
- Example: "Onboarding flow needs optimization (too many steps)"
- Example: "Referral system needs better rewards (XP not enough)"

## Pivots Based on Learning

### Pivot 1: [Pivot Name]
- **From:** [TODO: Previous approach]
- **To:** [TODO: New approach]
- **Reason:** [TODO: Why pivoted]
- **Result:** [TODO: Outcome]

### Pivot 2: [Pivot Name]
- **From:** [TODO: Previous approach]
- **To:** [TODO: New approach]
- **Reason:** [TODO: Why pivoted]
- **Result:** [TODO: Outcome]

## Reasoning Behind Current Approach

### Why Canadian-First?
- **Market Insight:** Canadian SMBs need Canadian integrations (Shopify, Wave, RBC, TD)
- **Competitive Advantage:** US-focused tools don't have Canadian integrations
- **Compliance:** PIPEDA compliance required for Canadian market
- **Result:** Defensible niche, strong differentiation

### Why $49/Month Pricing?
- **Market Research:** SMBs can't afford $150-500/month enterprise tools
- **Competitive Analysis:** Zapier costs $50/month for just 5 automations
- **Value Proposition:** $49/month for unlimited automations
- **Result:** Affordable pricing, clear value proposition

### Why Visual Workflow Builder?
- **User Research:** Non-technical users need no-code solution
- **Competitive Analysis:** Zapier/Make require technical setup
- **User Experience:** Drag-and-drop is more intuitive
- **Result:** Lower barrier to entry, higher adoption

## What We'd Do Differently

### If Starting Over
1. **Start with Concierge MVP:** Validate solution before building platform
2. **Run Customer Interviews Earlier:** Validate problem before building
3. **Focus on One Integration First:** Start with Shopify, then expand
4. **Optimize Onboarding Earlier:** Reduce steps, improve activation

---

## Next Steps

1. **Document Previous Iterations:** If any previous approaches exist, document them
2. **Document Learning:** Document what we learned from each iteration
3. **Update Current Approach:** Document what we're learning from current approach
4. **Plan Future Iterations:** Based on learnings, plan future iterations
