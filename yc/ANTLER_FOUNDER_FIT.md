# Antler Founder-Market Fit — AIAS Platform

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-29  
**Purpose:** Document founder's personal connection to problem and why founders are uniquely positioned to solve it

---

## Founder-Market Fit Statement

**Founder-Market Fit:** Founders have personal connection to problem (experienced it firsthand) and skills to solve it (technical + product + business).

---

## Personal Connection to Problem

### Founder Story Option 1: "The Frustrated Founder"

**Narrative:**
"I ran a Shopify store for 3 years and spent 15 hours/week on manual order processing. I tried Zapier but it cost $50/month for just 5 automations. I tried building custom solutions but they cost $10K+ and took months. I realized there was no affordable, Canadian-first automation platform for SMBs like me. So I built AIAS Platform to solve my own problem—and discovered 500K+ Canadian SMBs have the same pain."

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Add evidence — previous Shopify store, Zapier usage, custom development attempts]

**Why This Works:**
- Personal connection to problem
- Execution evidence (built solution)
- Market validation (500K+ SMBs)
- Clear "why now" (frustration → solution)

---

### Founder Story Option 2: "The Tool Builder"

**Narrative:**
"I've built automation tools for 3 previous companies. Each time, I saw the same pattern: SMBs need automation but can't afford enterprise tools ($150-500/month) or custom development ($10K-50K). I built AIAS Platform to give Canadian SMBs the same automation capabilities that big companies have, at a price they can afford ($49/month)."

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Add evidence — previous companies, automation tools built]

**Why This Works:**
- Technical credibility
- Domain expertise (automation)
- Execution evidence (built tools before)
- Clear value proposition (affordable enterprise features)

---

### Founder Story Option 3: "The Canadian Builder"

**Narrative:**
"I'm Canadian and I've seen how US-focused tools (Zapier, Make) don't work well for Canadian businesses. They're missing Canadian integrations (Shopify, Wave, RBC, TD), PIPEDA compliance, and Canadian pricing. I built AIAS Platform to be the first automation platform built specifically for Canadian SMBs—with native Canadian integrations and compliance built-in."

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Add evidence — Canadian background, experience with Canadian SMBs]

**Why This Works:**
- Market insight (Canadian-specific needs)
- Competitive differentiation (Canadian-first)
- Execution evidence (built platform)
- Clear positioning (niche market)
