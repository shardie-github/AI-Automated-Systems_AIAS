## Market Research

### Time Wasted on Repetitive Tasks

**Research Sources:**
- [TODO: Add research sources]
- Example: "Small Business Administration study shows SMBs spend 10-30 hours/week on admin tasks"

**Key Findings:**
- Average time wasted: 10-30 hours/week
- Most common tasks: Order processing, lead qualification, proposal writing
- Cost of inaction: $500-2,000/month in opportunity cost

## Competitive Alternatives

### Current Alternatives and Their Limitations

**1. Zapier**
- **Price:** $50/month for 5 automations
- **Limitations:** Too expensive for SMBs, limited Canadian integrations
- **Gap:** No Canadian-first approach, expensive pricing

**2. Make (formerly Integromat)**
- **Price:** $9-29/month (limited), $59+ for advanced
- **Limitations:** Complex setup, requires technical expertise
- **Gap:** Too complex for non-technical users, limited Canadian integrations

**3. Manual Processes**
- **Price:** $0 (but time cost)
- **Limitations:** Time-consuming, error-prone, doesn't scale
- **Gap:** Wastes 10-30 hours/week, leads to mistakes

**4. Custom Development**
- **Price:** $10K-50K one-time cost
- **Limitations:** Expensive, takes months, requires maintenance
- **Gap:** Too expensive for SMBs, long development time

**5. Enterprise Tools**
- **Price:** $150-500/month
- **Limitations:** Too expensive, overkill for SMBs
- **Gap:** Not affordable for SMBs, too complex

## Why Now? (Urgency)

### 1. AI Makes Automation Accessible
- **Before:** Automation required technical expertise or expensive custom development
- **Now:** AI-powered automation makes it accessible to non-technical users
- **Impact:** SMBs can now automate tasks without coding or expensive tools

### 2. Canadian SMB Market Growing
- **Trend:** Canadian e-commerce growing 20%+ year-over-year
- **Impact:** More SMBs need automation to scale
- **Opportunity:** Growing market = growing demand for automation

### 3. Remote Work Increases Need for Automation
- **Trend:** Remote work increases need for digital tools
- **Impact:** SMBs need automation to manage remote operations
- **Opportunity:** Remote work = increased demand for automation

### 4. Economic Pressure on SMBs
- **Trend:** Economic uncertainty forces SMBs to cut costs
- **Impact:** SMBs need affordable automation (vs. expensive enterprise tools)
- **Opportunity:** Economic pressure = demand for affordable solutions

## Market Opportunity

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
- **Global Automation Software Market:** $10B+ (2024)
- **Growth:** 20% CAGR
- **Conclusion:** Large, growing market

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
- **Canadian SMB Automation Market:** 500K+ businesses
- **E-Commerce SMBs:** 200K+ (40% of SMBs)
- **Target Segment:** 5K-10K businesses
- **SAM Calculation:** 5K businesses × $49/month × 12 months = $2.94M ARR (conservative)

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
- **Year 1 Target:** 1,000 paying customers
- **ARPU:** $49/month = $588/year
- **ARR:** 1,000 × $588 = $588K ARR
- **Conclusion:** Achievable target with focused execution

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- **Zapier:** $50/month for 5 automations (too expensive)
- **Make:** $9-59/month (too complex)
- **Microsoft Power Automate:** Enterprise-focused (too expensive)

### Indirect Competitors
- **Manual Processes:** Time-consuming, error-prone
- **Custom Development:** Expensive, long development time
- **Enterprise Tools:** Too expensive, overkill for SMBs

### Competitive Advantage

- SMBs can't scale without automation
- Manual processes don't scale
- Automation = growth enabler

**3. Economic Pressure**
- SMBs need to cut costs
- Automation reduces costs (time + errors)
- Automation = cost savings

**4. AI Makes It Possible**
- AI makes automation accessible
- No coding required
- AI = democratization of automation
