**Generated:** 2025-01-29  
**Status:** Draft — Founders to review and refine

## 1-Sentence Description

AIAS Platform helps Canadian small businesses automate repetitive tasks through visual workflow builders and AI agents, eliminating the need for expensive enterprise tools or custom development.

---

## 30-Second Explanation

Canadian SMBs waste 10-30 hours per week on manual tasks like order processing, lead qualification, and customer follow-ups. Existing automation tools cost $150-500/month and require technical expertise. AIAS Platform gives them visual workflow builders, pre-built templates, and Canadian-specific integrations (Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC) for $49/month—saving them 10+ hours per week while they focus on growing their business.

## 2-Minute Explanation

**The Problem:**  
Every day, Canadian small businesses waste countless hours on repetitive tasks. Sarah, a Shopify store owner, spends 3 hours daily on order confirmations and shipping labels. Mike, a consultant, writes 5-10 proposals per week manually. Jessica, a real estate agent, qualifies 30+ leads per week by hand. They can't afford enterprise automation tools ($150-500/month), and existing solutions like Zapier are too expensive for their needs ($50/month for just 5 automations) or too complex to set up.

**The Solution:**  
AIAS Platform is an enterprise-grade automation platform built specifically for Canadian SMBs. We provide:
- **Visual workflow builders** — drag, drop, connect. No coding required.
- **Pre-built templates** — Shopify order automation, lead qualification, proposal generation
- **Canadian-first integrations** — Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC, TD, Interac (20+ integrations)
- **Affordable pricing** — $49/month starter plan (vs. $150-500 competitors)
- **Enterprise security** — SOC 2, GDPR, PIPEDA compliance built-in

**The Result:**  
Sarah automates her Shopify orders in 30 minutes and saves 10 hours/week. Mike generates proposals in 5 minutes instead of 2 hours. Jessica qualifies leads automatically and closes 2x more deals. They all focus on growing their business, not managing repetitive tasks.
