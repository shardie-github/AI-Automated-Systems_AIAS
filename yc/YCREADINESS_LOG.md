### 2025-01-29: Initial YC Readiness Assessment

**What Was Reviewed:**
- Complete repository scan (Phase 0)
- YC Narrative Pack creation (Phase 1)
- Metrics instrumentation analysis (Phase 2)
- Distribution plan review (Phase 3)
- Tech architecture evaluation (Phase 4)
- Gap analysis (Phase 5)

**What Was Created:**
- `/yc/REPO_ORIENTATION.md` - Repo overview
- `/yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` - Product narrative
- `/yc/YC_PROBLEM_USERS.md` - Problem and users
- `/yc/YC_MARKET_VISION.md` - Market opportunity
- `/yc/YC_TEAM_NOTES.md` - Team information
- `/yc/YC_METRICS_CHECKLIST.md` - Metrics definitions
- `/yc/YC_METRICS_DASHBOARD_SKETCH.md` - Dashboard proposal
- `/yc/YC_DISTRIBUTION_PLAN.md` - Distribution strategy
- `/yc/YC_TECH_OVERVIEW.md` - Technical architecture
- `/yc/YC_DEFENSIBILITY_NOTES.md` - Potential moats
- `/yc/ENGINEERING_RISKS.md` - Technical risks
- `/yc/YC_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` - Gap analysis
- `/yc/YC_INTERVIEW_CHEATSHEET.md` - Interview prep
- `/yc/YCREADINESS_LOG.md` - This log

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Product is comprehensive (not just MVP)
- ✅ Metrics are instrumented (but need real data)
- ✅ Distribution plan exists (but needs validation)
- ⚠️ Missing real customer data (need to launch MVP)
- ⚠️ Missing real metrics data (need to track actual usage)
- ⚠️ Missing team information (need founder bios)

**Improvements Made:**
- Created comprehensive YC readiness documentation
- Identified gaps and prioritized fixes
- Created interview cheat sheet with placeholders

**Remaining Top 3 YC-Risk Areas:**
1. **Missing Real Customer Data** (HIGH severity)
   - No evidence of paying customers
   - Need to launch MVP and get first 10 customers
   - Action: Launch MVP, get first paying customer

2. **Missing Real Metrics Data** (HIGH severity)
   - Metrics are instrumented but no real data
   - Need to track actual usage, growth, revenue
   - Action: Launch MVP, start tracking metrics

3. **Missing Team Information** (HIGH severity)
   - No founder bios, LinkedIn profiles, team page
   - Need to create team page, add founder information
   - Action: Create team page, add founder bios

**Next Steps:**
1. Launch MVP and get first 10 customers
2. Start tracking real metrics (DAU, WAU, MAU, MRR)
3. Create team page with founder bios
4. Fill in interview cheat sheet with real data

## TODO: Founders to Update Regularly

- [ ] Update log after each major review or change
- [ ] Update "Remaining Top 3 YC-Risk Areas" as risks are addressed
- [ ] Document improvements made (what changed, why)
- [ ] Track progress toward YC readiness (metrics, customers, etc.)
- [ ] Review log weekly (identify new risks, close old ones)
