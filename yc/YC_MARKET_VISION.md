## Initial Wedge: Which Niche We're Starting With and Why

**The Wedge: Canadian E-Commerce SMBs (Shopify Store Owners)**

**Why This Niche:**
1. **Largest Segment:** 40% of Canadian SMBs are e-commerce operators
2. **Clear Pain Point:** Manual order processing (5-10 hrs/week)
3. **Proven Demand:** Shopify has 1M+ stores globally, 100K+ in Canada
4. **Native Integration:** Shopify has robust API (easy to integrate)
5. **High Value:** Order automation saves 10+ hours/week = $500+ value/month
6. **Network Effects:** Shopify App Store provides distribution channel

**The Strategy:**
- Start with Shopify order automation (pre-built template)
- Target solo e-commerce operators ($100K-$5M revenue)
- Focus on Ontario, BC, Quebec (largest markets)
- Price at $49/month (fits budget, clear ROI)
- Expand to other niches after product-market fit

**Why This Wedge Works:**
- **Specific:** Not "all SMBs" — focused on Shopify store owners
- **Painful:** Manual order processing wastes 10+ hours/week
- **Winnable:** Shopify integration is straightforward, competitors don't focus on Canada
- **Scalable:** 100K+ Shopify stores in Canada, 1M+ globally
