# Lean Startup Learnings — AIAS Platform

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-29  
**Purpose:** Document build-measure-learn cycles, pivots, and changes based on learning

---

## Build-Measure-Learn Cycles

### Cycle 1: Onboarding Flow

**Build:**
- Built 5-step onboarding wizard
- Added progress indicators
- Tracked activation metrics

**Measure:**
- Activation rate: [TODO: %]
- Time-to-activation: [TODO: Days]
- Drop-off rate: [TODO: %]

**Learn:**
- [TODO: What we learned]
- Example: "Onboarding has too many steps, users drop off at step 3"

**Next Steps:**
- [TODO: What we'll do next]
- Example: "Reduce to 3 steps, optimize for faster activation"

---

### Cycle 2: Workflow Builder

**Build:**
- Built visual drag-and-drop workflow builder
- Added pre-built templates
- Tracked workflow creation metrics

**Measure:**
- Workflow creation rate: [TODO: %]
- Workflow execution rate: [TODO: %]
- User satisfaction: [TODO: Score]

**Learn:**
- [TODO: What we learned]
- Example: "Users need more guidance, templates help"

**Next Steps:**
- [TODO: What we'll do next]
- Example: "Add more templates, improve guidance"

---

### Cycle 3: Pricing Strategy

**Build:**
- Defined pricing tiers ($0, $49, $149)
- Created pricing page
- Tracked conversion metrics

**Measure:**
- Conversion rate (free → paid): [TODO: %]
- ARPU: [TODO: $]
- LTV:CAC: [TODO: Ratio]

**Learn:**
- [TODO: What we learned]
- Example: "Pricing is right, but need better value communication"

**Next Steps:**
- [TODO: What we'll do next]
- Example: "Test pricing page copy, emphasize benefits"
