**Status:** Template — Founders to customize

---

## Overview

This document outlines the fundraising plan for AIAS Platform, including how much we need, when we need it, and why.

**Key Principle:** YC wants to see that founders understand their financial needs and have a clear plan for using funds.

---

## How Much Do We Need?

### Target: $500K - $1M

**Rationale:**
- Enough to hire team and scale for 18-24 months
- Reach $50K-100K MRR (prove product-market fit)
- Build enterprise features (expand market)
- Expand to US market (if Canadian market validated)

---

## When Do We Need It?

### Timeline: 6-12 Months

**Triggers:**
- MRR reaches $10K-20K (prove traction)
- Runway <6 months (urgent need)
- Ready to scale (hire team, expand marketing)

**Current Status:** [TODO: Fill in - what's your current MRR? Runway?]

  - Build partnerships
  - Create content

**Total Team Costs:** $400K-550K/year
