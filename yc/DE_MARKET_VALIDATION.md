## Bottom-Up Validation

### Can We Reach 1,000 Customers in Year 1?

**Channel 1: Shopify App Store**
- **Installs:** 100/month × 12 months = 1,200 installs/year
- **Activation Rate:** 20% = 240 activations/year
- **Conversion Rate:** 20% = 48 paying customers/year

**Channel 2: SEO/Content Marketing**
- **Organic Traffic:** 1,000 visitors/month × 12 months = 12,000 visitors/year
- **Signup Rate:** 5% = 600 signups/year
- **Conversion Rate:** 20% = 120 paying customers/year

**Channel 3: Referrals**
- **Referral Signups:** 100/year
- **Conversion Rate:** 50% = 50 paying customers/year

**Total Year 1:** 48 + 120 + 50 = 218 paying customers

**Gap:** Need 782 more customers to reach 1,000

**Options:**
1. Scale Shopify App Store (500 installs/month → 240 paying/year)
2. Scale SEO (5,000 visitors/month → 600 paying/year)
3. Add paid ads ($10K/month → 200 paying/year)
4. Add partnerships (100 referrals/month → 600 paying/year)

## Assumptions and Risks

### Assumptions
1. **Activation Rate:** 20% (installs → activated)
2. **Conversion Rate:** 20% (activated → paying)
3. **Churn Rate:** 5% monthly (need to validate)
4. **ARPU:** $49/month (need to validate)

### Risks
1. **Activation Rate Lower:** If activation rate is 10% instead of 20%, need 2x installs
2. **Conversion Rate Lower:** If conversion rate is 10% instead of 20%, need 2x activations
3. **Churn Rate Higher:** If churn rate is 10% instead of 5%, LTV decreases
4. **ARPU Lower:** If ARPU is $29 instead of $49, revenue decreases
