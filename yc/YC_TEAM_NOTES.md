## Team Information from Repo

### Founders/Team

**Founder Information:**

**Scott Hardie** — Founder & CEO
- **Location:** Toronto, Canada
- **GitHub:** [shardie-github](https://github.com/shardie-github)
- **LinkedIn:** [scottrmhardie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottrmhardie)
- **Company:** Hardonian Industries
- **Website:** Hardonia.store
- **GitHub Activity:** 40+ public repositories, active since 2022
- **Role:** Technical founder, full-stack developer, product builder

**Background (from GitHub/repo):**
- Based in Toronto, Canada (strong Canadian market understanding)
- Active developer with 40+ public repositories
- Built Hardonian Industries (previous/current venture)
- Experience with e-commerce (Hardonia.store)
- Strong technical execution (comprehensive platform built)

**From `package.json`:**
- **Author:** "AIAS Platform Team"
- **Email:** team@aias-platform.com
- **URL:** https://aias-platform.com

**From `VALUE_PROPOSITION.md`:**
- Contains "Founder Vision" section:
  > "I built this because I was tired of watching great ideas fail not because they were bad ideas, but because the founders didn't have access to the right tools."
  > "I built this because I believe that the best businesses aren't built by the biggest teams or the deepest pockets—they're built by people who refuse to accept limitations."

**Inference:**  
Solo founder (Scott Hardie) building this platform. Strong technical execution, Canadian market focus, e-commerce experience (Hardonia.store), and personal experience with the problem (watching founders struggle with tools).

## Suggested "Founder Stories" for YC Application

### Story Option 1: "The Frustrated Founder"

**Narrative:**
> "I ran a Shopify store for 3 years and spent 15 hours/week on manual order processing. I tried Zapier but it cost $50/month for just 5 automations. I tried building custom solutions but they cost $10K+ and took months. I realized there was no affordable, Canadian-first automation platform for SMBs like me. So I built AIAS Platform to solve my own problem—and discovered 500K+ Canadian SMBs have the same pain."

**Why This Works:**
- Personal connection to problem
- Execution evidence (built solution)
- Market validation (500K+ SMBs)
- Clear "why now" (frustration → solution)

---

### Story Option 2: "The Tool Builder"

**Narrative:**
> "I've built automation tools for 3 previous companies. Each time, I saw the same pattern: SMBs need automation but can't afford enterprise tools ($150-500/month) or custom development ($10K-50K). I built AIAS Platform to give Canadian SMBs the same automation capabilities that big companies have, at a price they can afford ($49/month)."

**Why This Works:**
- Technical credibility
- Domain expertise (automation)
- Execution evidence (built tools before)
- Clear value proposition (affordable enterprise features)

---

### Story Option 3: "The Canadian Builder"

**Narrative:**
> "I'm Canadian and I've seen how US-focused tools (Zapier, Make) don't work well for Canadian businesses. They're missing Canadian integrations (Shopify, Wave, RBC, TD), PIPEDA compliance, and Canadian pricing. I built AIAS Platform to be the first automation platform built specifically for Canadian SMBs—with native Canadian integrations and compliance built-in."

**Why This Works:**
- Market insight (Canadian-specific needs)
- Competitive differentiation (Canadian-first)
- Execution evidence (built platform)
- Clear positioning (niche market)
