## Section A: CORE PITCH

### 1-Sentence Answer to "What are you working on?"

**Answer:**  
"AIAS Platform helps Canadian small businesses automate repetitive tasks through visual workflow builders and AI agents, eliminating the need for expensive enterprise tools or custom development."

**Practice:** Say this in one breath, 10 seconds max.

---

### 3-5 Bullets: "What's New and Why It's Important"

**Answer:**
1. **Canadian-First:** Native integrations with Canadian tools (Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC, TD, Interac) that competitors don't have
2. **Visual Builder:** Drag-and-drop workflow builder (no coding) vs. Zapier's technical setup
3. **Affordable:** $49/month starter plan vs. $150-500/month competitors
4. **AI-Powered:** AI agents for intelligent automation (vs. rule-based only)
5. **Enterprise Security:** SOC 2, GDPR, PIPEDA compliance included (not add-on)

**Practice:** Say these in 30 seconds, emphasize differentiation.

---

## Section B: USERS & PROBLEM

### Who Are Your Users?

**Answer:**  
"Canadian small businesses, specifically:
- **40% are e-commerce operators** (Shopify store owners) who waste 10+ hours/week on manual order processing
- **30% are consultants** who waste 10-20 hours/week writing proposals manually
- **Tertiary: Real estate agents** who waste 30+ hours/week qualifying leads manually

Total addressable market: 500K+ Canadian SMBs."

**Practice:** Know these percentages and pain points cold.

---

### What Pain Do They Have?

**Answer:**  
"Three main pains:
1. **Time waste:** 10-30 hours/week on repetitive tasks (order processing, proposal writing, lead qualification)
2. **Cost:** Can't afford enterprise tools ($150-500/month) or Zapier ($50/month for just 5 automations)
3. **Complexity:** Existing tools require technical expertise (webhooks, API keys) that SMBs don't have

Result: They're stuck with manual processes, can't scale, lose customers to faster competitors."

**Practice:** Quantify the pain (hours/week, dollars/month).

### Question 5: "What happens if a big competitor (Zapier, Make) copies you?"
