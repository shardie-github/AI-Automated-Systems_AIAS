## Why Building AIAS Platform

### Personal Connection to Problem

**E-commerce Experience:**
- Ran Hardonia.store (Shopify store)
- Spent 15+ hours/week on manual order processing
- Tried existing tools (Zapier, Make) but found them:
  - Too expensive ($50/month for just 5 automations)
  - Too complex to set up
  - Missing Canadian integrations (Shopify, Wave Accounting, RBC)

**Founder Vision (from VALUE_PROPOSITION.md):**
> "I built this because I was tired of watching great ideas fail not because they were bad ideas, but because the founders didn't have access to the right tools."
> "I built this because I believe that the best businesses aren't built by the biggest teams or the deepest pockets—they're built by people who refuse to accept limitations."

### Market Insight

**Canadian Market Focus:**
- Based in Toronto (deep understanding of Canadian market)
- Recognized gap: No Canadian-first automation platform
- Opportunity: 500K+ Canadian SMBs need affordable automation
