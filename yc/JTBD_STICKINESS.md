# Jobs-to-Be-Done Stickiness — AIAS Platform

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-29  
**Purpose:** Document what makes users stick: switching costs, network effects, habit formation

---

## Sticky Mechanisms

### 1. Switching Costs

**What:** Users invest time building workflows, which creates switching costs.

**How It Works:**
- Users build workflows on AIAS Platform (time investment)
- Workflows become embedded in operations (critical to business)
- Switching to another platform requires rebuilding workflows (high cost)

**Evidence:**
- Workflows are embedded in operations (order processing, lead qualification)
- Users invest time learning platform (onboarding, workflow creation)
- Data stored in platform (workflow configurations, execution history)

**Impact:**
- High switching costs = low churn rate
- Users less likely to switch to competitors
- Increases customer lifetime value (LTV)

---

### 2. Network Effects

**What:** More users = more templates = more value.

**How It Works:**
- Users create workflows and templates
- Templates shared with other users
- More templates = more value for all users

**Evidence:**
- Workflow templates exist (order processing, lead qualification)
- Template marketplace planned (users can share templates)
- Referral system exists (users refer friends)

**Impact:**
- Network effects = increasing value over time
- More users = more templates = more value
- Creates competitive moat

---

### 3. Habit Formation

**What:** Users form habits around using AIAS Platform daily.

**How It Works:**
- Users check dashboard daily (workflow performance)
- Users create workflows regularly (new automations)
- Users optimize workflows (continuous improvement)

**Evidence:**
- Dashboard exists (users check workflow performance)
- Workflow builder exists (users create workflows)
- Metrics tracking exists (users see value)

**Impact:**
- Habit formation = high retention rate
- Daily usage = high engagement
- Increases customer lifetime value (LTV)

## Retention Drivers

### Driver 1: Workflow Embedding
- **What:** Workflows become embedded in operations
- **Impact:** High switching costs, low churn rate
- **Evidence:** Workflows critical to business operations

### Driver 2: Time Investment
- **What:** Users invest time learning platform
- **Impact:** High switching costs, low churn rate
- **Evidence:** Onboarding, workflow creation takes time

### Driver 3: Value Realization
- **What:** Users see value (time saved, errors reduced)
- **Impact:** High satisfaction, high retention
- **Evidence:** Metrics show time saved, errors reduced

### Driver 4: Continuous Improvement
- **What:** Users optimize workflows continuously
- **Impact:** High engagement, high retention
- **Evidence:** Users update workflows regularly

## Switching Costs Analysis

### Cost of Switching to Zapier
- **Time Cost:** Rebuild workflows (10-20 hours)
- **Learning Cost:** Learn Zapier interface (5-10 hours)
- **Data Migration:** Export/import data (2-5 hours)
- **Total Cost:** 17-35 hours = $850-1,750 (at $50/hour)

### Cost of Switching to Make
- **Time Cost:** Rebuild workflows (10-20 hours)
- **Learning Cost:** Learn Make interface (10-15 hours)
- **Data Migration:** Export/import data (2-5 hours)
- **Total Cost:** 22-40 hours = $1,100-2,000 (at $50/hour)

### Cost of Switching to Manual Process
- **Time Cost:** Manual processes (15 hours/week = 60 hours/month)
- **Error Cost:** Manual errors (lost orders, wrong addresses)
- **Opportunity Cost:** Can't scale without automation
- **Total Cost:** Very high (time + errors + opportunity cost)

## Network Effects Analysis

### Current State
- **Templates:** Pre-built templates exist
- **Sharing:** Template marketplace planned
- **Network Size:** [TODO: Number of users]

### Future State
- **Templates:** Users create and share templates
- **Marketplace:** Template marketplace with revenue share
- **Network Size:** 1,000+ users = 100+ templates

### Value Increase
- **Current:** 10 templates = X value
- **Future:** 100 templates = 10X value
- **Network Effect:** More users = more templates = more value

---

## Habit Formation Analysis

### Daily Habits
- **Check Dashboard:** Users check workflow performance daily
- **Monitor Workflows:** Users monitor workflow executions
- **Optimize Workflows:** Users optimize workflows regularly

### Weekly Habits
- **Create Workflows:** Users create new workflows weekly
- **Review Metrics:** Users review time saved, errors reduced
- **Upgrade Features:** Users upgrade to Pro for more features

### Monthly Habits
- **Analyze Performance:** Users analyze workflow performance monthly
- **Optimize Costs:** Users optimize workflow costs
- **Refer Friends:** Users refer friends monthly

---

## Retention Metrics

### Current Retention
- **30-Day Retention:** [TODO: %]
- **90-Day Retention:** [TODO: %]
- **Annual Retention:** [TODO: %]

### Target Retention
- **30-Day Retention:** 50%+ (target)
- **90-Day Retention:** 40%+ (target)
- **Annual Retention:** 30%+ (target)

## Next Steps

1. **Track Switching Costs:** Measure time to rebuild workflows
2. **Build Network Effects:** Launch template marketplace
3. **Encourage Habits:** Add daily/weekly engagement features
4. **Measure Retention:** Track retention metrics
