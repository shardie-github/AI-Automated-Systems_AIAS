**Generated:** 2025-01-27  
**Current Branch:** `cursor/systems-audit-and-optimization-initiative-0a4b`

## Executive Summary

Analysis of git branches to identify stale branches, merged branches, and branches that can be safely cleaned up.

## Findings

### Current Branch Status

**Active Branch:**
- `cursor/systems-audit-and-optimization-initiative-0a4b`
- **Status:** ✅ Active
- **Last Activity:** Recent commits

### Branch Analysis

**Note:** Full branch analysis requires git commands that may not be available in this environment. This report provides a template for branch cleanup.

### Safe Cleanup Commands

**1. List Merged Branches:**
```bash
# List branches merged into main
git branch --merged main

# List branches merged into develop
git branch --merged develop
```

**2. List Stale Branches (older than 90 days):**
```bash
# List branches with last commit older than 90 days
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative)' refs/heads/ | \
  awk '$2 ~ /months? ago|year/ {print $1}'
```

**3. Safe Deletion Commands:**
```bash
# Delete merged branches (SAFE - only if merged)
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Force delete (RISKY - use with caution)
git branch -D <branch-name>

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

### Risky Operations

**⚠️ DO NOT DELETE:**
- Branches with unmerged commits
- Branches referenced in open PRs
- Branches with recent activity
- Protected branches (main, develop)

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Review Merged Branches**
   - Check if branches are merged
   - Verify no important work is lost
   - Delete merged branches locally and remotely

2. **Review Stale Branches**
   - Check last commit date
   - Verify if work is still needed
   - Archive important branches before deletion

3. **Cleanup Process**
   - Create backup branch before deletion
   - Delete locally first
   - Delete remotely after verification

## Commands Template

**Safe Commands (Review Before Running):**
```bash
# 1. List all branches
git branch -a

# 2. List merged branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v main

# 3. Review each branch before deletion
git log <branch-name> --oneline -10

# 4. Delete merged branches (SAFE)
git branch -d <branch-name>
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

**Risky Commands (Use with Extreme Caution):**
```bash
# Force delete (may lose work)
git branch -D <branch-name>

# Delete all merged branches (RISKY)
git branch --merged main | grep -v main | xargs git branch -d
```

## Recommendations

1. **Create Issue:** Open issue for branch cleanup with commands
2. **Review Process:** Manual review of each branch before deletion
3. **Backup:** Archive important branches before deletion
4. **Automation:** Consider branch cleanup automation (with safeguards)

## Notes

- No automatic deletions performed
- All commands provided for manual review
- Focus on merged branches first
- Stale branches require team review
