## Model Assumptions & Limitations

### Key Assumptions

- **Revenue Growth:** Assumes consistent MoM growth with no major disruptions
- **CAC Improvement:** Assumes continuous optimization and learning
- **LTV Growth:** Assumes product improvements drive retention
- **Refund Rate:** Assumes onboarding improvements reduce refunds
- **Operating Expenses:** Assumes controlled scaling of team and infrastructure

### Model Limitations

1. **No Seasonality:** Model assumes linear growth; real business may have seasonal patterns
2. **No Churn Modeling:** LTV calculated as simple average; doesn't model cohort churn curves
3. **Fixed COGS%:** Assumes COGS scales linearly with revenue; may not hold at scale
4. **No Funding Events:** Model doesn't account for additional capital raises
5. **No Macro Shocks:** Model doesn't account for economic downturns or market shifts

### Confidence Levels

- **Base Scenario:** 65% confidence (most likely)
- **Optimistic Scenario:** 25% confidence (requires strong execution)
- **Conservative Scenario:** 10% confidence (assumes multiple headwinds)

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Assumptions:** Review historical data to calibrate model inputs
2. **Set Up Tracking:** Implement dashboards for CAC, LTV, refund rate, cash runway
3. **Create Alerts:** Set up automated alerts for key metric thresholds
4. **Monthly Review:** Update model monthly with actuals vs. forecast
