## E2. Master Revenue + Narrative Blueprint

### Context Snapshot

**Product:** AIAS Platform – Build AI agents and automation workflows that actually work

**Category:** B2B SaaS automation platform for small businesses

**Target Users:**
- **Solo E-Commerce Operators** – Shopify store owners, $100K-$5M revenue, need order automation
- **Independent Consultants** – Business consultants, freelancers, $50K-$2M revenue, need proposal automation
- **Real Estate Agents** – Solo agents, commission-based, need lead qualification automation

**Stage:** MVP / Beta

**Revenue Model:** SaaS subscription (tiered plans)

**Traction:** Assumed early stage – platform built, pricing validated at $49/month starter tier

---

### Pricing System Overview

#### Value Metrics (Primary: AI Agents)
1. **AI Agents** – Number of active agents deployed (primary metric)
2. **Automations Executed** – Workflow executions per month (usage metric)
3. **Workflows Active** – Number of active workflow templates (breadth metric)
4. **API Calls / Integrations** – Integration usage (infrastructure metric)
5. **Team Members / Seats** – User count (team metric)

**Decision:** AI Agents chosen as primary value metric for simplicity and alignment with product positioning.

#### Pricing Model: Tiered Plans (Current)
- **Free:** $0/month (3 agents, 100 automations/month)
- **Starter:** $49/month (10 agents, unlimited automations) – **Most Popular**
- **Pro:** $149/month (50 agents, advanced features)
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing ($500-$2000/month)

**Rationale:** Tiered plans provide predictable revenue, clear upgrade path, and simplicity for SMB customers.

#### Key Pricing Decisions
1. **$49/month Starter** – Targets pain point ($150-500 competitors), delivers $500+ value/month
2. **Unlimited automations** – Removes usage anxiety, encourages experimentation
3. **20% annual discount** – Improves cash flow, reduces churn risk
4. **Free tier** – Low barrier to entry, drives signups

### Narrative Summary

#### Core Story Arc

**Problem:** Canadian SMBs waste 10-30 hours/week on manual tasks. Can't afford $150-500/month enterprise tools. Existing solutions too expensive or too complex.

**Solution:** AIAS Platform provides visual workflow builder + AI agents + Canadian-first integrations for $49/month. 20 minutes to deploy first automation.

**Early Traction:** MVP complete, pricing validated, architecture scales. Target: 100 paying customers in 90 days, $5K MRR by end of Q2.

**Market:** 500K+ Canadian SMBs × $50-200/month = $300M+ TAM. AI adoption accelerating, labor shortage driving automation demand.

**Moat:** Network effects (more users = more templates), data moat (Canadian business context), integration depth (20+ Canadian integrations), switching costs (embedded workflows).

**Plan & Ask:** Raising $500K-$1M pre-seed at $3M-$5M valuation. 40% sales/marketing, 30% product, 20% team, 10% operations. 18-month runway to Series A.

#### Key Differentiators
1. **Canadian-First** – Native integrations (Shopify, Wave, RBC, TD) + PIPEDA compliance
2. **Visual Builder** – No coding required vs. Zapier's technical setup
3. **Affordable** – $49/month vs. $150-500/month competitors
4. **AI-Powered** – Intelligent agents vs. rule-based only
5. **All-in-One** – Workflows + agents + integrations + analytics

### Experiments Roadmap (Next 90 Days)

#### Phase 1: Low-Risk Experiments (Days 1-30)
1. **Value Metric Presentation** – Test agent-focused vs. automation-focused vs. outcome-focused copy
2. **Annual Discount** – Test 10% vs. 20% vs. no discount
3. **Feature Gating** – Test restrictive vs. generous Starter plan

**Goal:** Optimize conversion without risking revenue.

#### Phase 2: Pricing Experiments (Days 31-60)
1. **Price Point Test** – Test $39/$49/$59 variants for Starter plan
2. **Free Tier vs. Trial** – Test free tier vs. 14-day trial vs. hybrid

**Goal:** Validate optimal price point and acquisition model.

#### Phase 3: Activation Experiments (Days 61-90)
1. **Onboarding** – Test self-serve vs. done-for-you vs. hybrid
2. **Feature Usage** – Track which features drive upgrades

**Goal:** Improve activation and conversion rates.

#### Success Metrics
- **Primary:** Signup rate, trial-to-paid conversion (target 10%), ARPU ($588/year)
- **Guardrails:** Activation rate, support load, NPS, churn (<5% monthly)
