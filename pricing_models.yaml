# A1. Value Metrics
value_metrics:
  - name: "AI Agents"
    description: "Number of active AI agents deployed"
    why_correlates_with_value: |
      Each AI agent represents a distinct automation capability (lead qualification, 
      proposal generation, customer support). More agents = more value delivered.
    pros:
      - Simple to understand and communicate
      - Easy to track and enforce
      - Aligns with product positioning (AI agent marketplace)
    cons:
      - May not reflect actual usage intensity
      - Could encourage hoarding unused agents
      - Doesn't capture workflow complexity

  - name: "Automations Executed"
    description: "Number of workflow automations run per month"
    why_correlates_with_value: |
      Directly measures actual value delivered. Each automation execution saves 
      time and reduces manual work. Scales with business growth.
    pros:
      - Directly correlates with value (time saved)
      - Fair pricing model (pay for what you use)
      - Encourages active usage
    cons:
      - Can be unpredictable (revenue volatility)
      - May discourage experimentation
      - Requires careful tiering to avoid bill shock

  - name: "Workflows Active"
    description: "Number of active workflow templates deployed"
    why_correlates_with_value: |
      Represents breadth of automation coverage. More workflows = more 
      processes automated = more value delivered.
    pros:
      - Captures breadth of automation
      - Predictable pricing for customers
      - Encourages comprehensive automation
    cons:
      - Doesn't reflect usage intensity
      - May not scale well for high-volume users
      - Less intuitive than "agents" or "automations"

  - name: "API Calls / Integrations"
    description: "Number of API calls made to external integrations per month"
    why_correlates_with_value: |
      Measures actual integration usage. More API calls = more data synced = 
      more value from connected tools.
    pros:
      - Very granular measurement
      - Aligns with infrastructure costs
      - Fair for high-volume users
    cons:
      - Complex to explain to non-technical users
      - Can lead to bill shock
      - Requires careful monitoring and alerts

  - name: "Team Members / Seats"
    description: "Number of users with access to the platform"
    why_correlates_with_value: |
      More team members = more people benefiting from automation = more 
      organizational value delivered.
    pros:
      - Industry-standard model (easy to understand)
      - Predictable revenue
      - Scales with company growth
    cons:
      - May not reflect actual usage
      - Can discourage team adoption
      - Less aligned with value delivered vs. headcount
